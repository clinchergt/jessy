Java console Chessprogram

Hands on experience is the best way for me to learn.

Did this project just to get more familiar with Java.
My goal was to put to use what I learned about the language. Classes, Exceptions and such.

I never intended to build a complete chess program.

So you can put pieces on the board and move them around.

## Bootstrapping ##

Get it: `git clone https://github.com/jubalh/jessy`

Change directory: `cd jessy/src`

Compile: `javac jessy/*.java`

Run: `java jessy.Chess` 

Or open it with Eclipse.

## Use ##

Abbreviations of figures:
__P__ for pawn

__N__ for knight

As you see you need to type the letter in upper-case.
Field letter in lower-case.
