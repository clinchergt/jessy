Java console Chessprogram

Hands on experience is the best way for me to learn.

Did this project just to get more familiar with Java.
My goal was to put to use what I learned about the language. Classes, Exceptions and such.

I never intended to build a complete chess program.

So you can put pieces on the board and move them around.
